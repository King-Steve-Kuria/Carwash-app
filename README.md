# Carwash-app
Group project 
This is a group project made by a group of 4 people, Jay Patel, Nirali Patel, Jaymin Chauhan and Steve Kuria. We collaborated to make a school project mobile application which deals with car wash services.
The application features 2 sides, the owner side and the customer side.
The owner side provides a template for the business owner of the carwash to identify and manage the customers that he/she has received for the business on a day to day basis.
The customer side begins with an interface in which customers can either log in directly or sign up to access the services of the business. After access, they can then identify the type of vehicle in which they intend to bring for the wash, identify the prices as well as the location services for the car wash. After that, they come across the payment features offered which in this case included cash at desk or Mpesa paybill no.
Had a good time working with my fellow colleagues and will look forward to more collaborations in the nearby future.
